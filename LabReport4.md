## Edit the code file to fix the failing test
**Keys Pressed:**
- Pressed `<Ctrl-D>` three times to quickly exit the current prompt.
- In the file `ListExamples.java`, located the line 44 where `index1 += 1;` is present.
- Used `<right>` arrow key six times to move the cursor to the number 1 in `index1`.
- Entered the text editor with `<i>` for insert mode, replaced the number 1 with 2, and exited with `<Esc>`, followed by `:wq`.

## Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
