working directory: /Users/chenjunrong
Explanation: When you use cd with no arguments, it doesn't change your working directory; it simply keeps you in the current directory.

*Example 2: using the command with a path to a directory as an argument--direct to download directory

working directory: /Users/chenjunrong/Downloads
Explanation: The cd command followed by a directory path changes the working directory to the specified directory.

*Example 3: the command with a path to a file as an argument--does not work; cd only works with directory

working directory: /Users/chenjunrong/Downloads
Explanation: The cd command is used to change directories, and you cannot change to a file because files are not directories. This results in an error.
